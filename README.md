# Breast Cancer Image Classification using Transfer Learning

This project applies transfer learning to classify ultrasound images of breast tissue into three categories: benign, malignant, and normal. It leverages pre-trained models from the Keras library, modifies them for the specific task, and evaluates their performance based on several metrics.

## Project Structure

- `Transfer_Learning_Assignment.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full pipeline from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
- `models/`: Directory where trained models are saved.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of ultrasound images of breast tissue categorized into three classes: benign, malignant, and normal. Each class contains images along with corresponding segmentation masks, though this project currently focuses only on classification.

## Models Used

The following pre-trained models from the TensorFlow Keras library were used and fine-tuned:

- **VGG16**: Known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification.
- **ResNet50**: Utilizes residual connections to enable training of very deep networks.
- **InceptionV3**: Known for handling variable image sizes and complexities due to its inception modules.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python installed on your machine, as well as the following Python libraries:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these packages via pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that the dataset is stored at the correct path, as specified in the notebook.
3. Open the `Transfer_Learning_Assignment.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or another IPython notebook viewer.
4. Run the cells sequentially to perform the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated based on the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Loss
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

These metrics are crucial for assessing the performance of the models, particularly in a medical context where accuracy and reliability are paramount.

## Results

The results section will contain tables and charts generated from the notebook, providing a visual and quantitative comparison of the performance of the different models.

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcome. You can contribute by improving the model training pipeline, introducing new models, or enhancing the data preprocessing steps.
